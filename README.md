Create an interactive experience consisting of two parts: a desktop web app and a mobile web app. You'll be using the mobile web app to control the desktop web app. Use both platforms for their strengths. Bonus points: useful audio/video integration, webrtc data channels, use of API's outside of the lesson scope.
